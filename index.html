        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a DevOps Engineer, I specialize in optimizing cloud infrastructure and streamlining software delivery processes. My expertise in Microsoft Azure, Terraform, and DevOps practices drives innovation and efficiency in managing and deploying cloud solutions.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ With advanced skills in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), I design and implement robust CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub. My focus is on automating software releases, ensuring smooth and reliable deployments while maintaining high code quality.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ I leverage Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate, manage, and provision cloud resources. My proficiency includes creating reusable modules, managing state files, and ensuring consistent and scalable infrastructure deployments.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ Certified in Azure Cloud Fundamentals, Azure AI Fundamentals, and Azure Administrator Associate, I optimize Azure environments for peak performance, security, and scalability. My experience includes managing Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, and Azure DevOps services.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ I incorporate security practices into the DevOps lifecycle, using tools like tfsec, Terrascan, and Checkov to ensure secure and compliant infrastructure deployments. My approach integrates security seamlessly into the development and deployment processes.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ Expert in monitoring and logging, I use solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, and Azure Monitor to track system performance in real-time, troubleshoot issues, and ensure operational stability.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ Skilled in Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, I manage, scale, and secure containerized applications. My experience includes designing and implementing container strategies to enhance deployment flexibility and resource utilization.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ With expertise in Helm and ArgoCD, I streamline application deployment and management, ensuring consistent and reliable releases across environments.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ I utilize SonarQube and SonarCloud for continuous code quality inspection, identifying and addressing code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities early in the development process.</p>
        <p>ðŸ”¹ Proficient in Azure Cloud Defender, I implement robust security measures to protect cloud resources from threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Let's connect to discuss how we can drive DevOps excellence, optimize cloud infrastructure, and leverage advanced monitoring and security practices to achieve business goals!</p>
